# Push Swap Project

## Overview

The Push Swap project is part of the 42 network curriculum, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and optimization. The goal is to sort a stack of numbers with the least number of operations using a limited set of stack operations.

## Concepts Learned

### Algorithm Design

* **Sorting Algorithms**: Understanding and implementing efficient sorting algorithms.
* **Optimization**: Developing strategies to minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack.

### Data Structures

* **Stacks**: Implementing and managing stack data structures.
* **Operations**: Using stack operations such as `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrr`.

### Problem-Solving

* **Greedy Algorithms**: Applying greedy techniques to make locally optimal choices.
* **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms.

## Project Description

**Push Swap**: The project consists of two programs - `push_swap` and `checker`.

### Push Swap

- Takes a list of integers and sorts them using a minimal sequence of stack operations.
- Outputs the operations required to sort the stack.

### Checker

- Takes a list of integers and a sequence of operations.
- Verifies if the operations sort the stack correctly.

## Implementation

* **Sorting Algorithm**: Design and implement an efficient algorithm to sort the stack.
* **Stack Operations**: Implement stack operations to manipulate the stack.
